# INTEL JTAG UART

`intel_jtag_uart` is a Python module that can be used to interact the JTAG UART instances inside
Intel FPGA designs.

The official ways to interact with the JTAG UART are either interactively, through `nios2-terminal` utility,
or by scripting some TCL code inside the Quartus System Console. There is no straightforward way
to interact with a JTAG UART with a Python script. 

This module is a wrapper around the `jtag_atlantic` shared librarie/DLL that is part of any
modern Quartus installation. (`jtag_atlantic` is the internal code name for the JTAG UART.)

To use this module, you need access to the `jtag_atlantic` shared library as well as the `jtag_client`
shared library, which provides lower level JTAG-related functions.

## Usage

* Install the library with `pip3 install intel_jtag_uart`.
* Point to the `jtag_atlantic` and `jtag_client` shared libraries, so that the module can find it.

    The module uses the following sequence to find these libraries:

    1. Look in the directory in which `intel_jtag_uart.py` is located
    1. Look in the directory in which the executable that uses this module is located
    1. Use the OS-provided way to find shared libraries. (E.g. for Linux, it will check
       the directories of the `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.) 
    1. Look in the `$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR` directory

* Use some variation of the script below:

```python
import intel_jtag_uart

try:
    ju = intel_jtag_uart.intel_jtag_uart()

except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    sys.exit(0)

ju.write(b'r')
time.sleep(1)
print("read: ", ju.read())
```

The script above sends `r` to the JTAG UART, waits 1 seconds for a reply, and reads the
reply, if there is any.

This module is a very thin wrapper around a handful of function calls that are mostly self-explanatory.
